## Project Challenges
*  One of the largest challenges for me in this project turned out to be making sure that I had both my api and html routes written correctly. I spent the most time making adgustments to those routes repeatedly in order to get the application to run.
Also, at the time of deploying the application, I was still unable to get the "delete" function to work, in spite of spending hours over the course of several days tweaking that section of code.
